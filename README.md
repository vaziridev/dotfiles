# dotfiles
This is just a backup of configuration files in case something ever goes wrong.
## Configurations
These files are for my personal laptop, which primarily utilises the following:
* [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) - OS
* [Xorg](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg) - Display Server
* [i3-gaps](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/i3-gaps/) - Window Manager
* [i3blocks](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/i3blocks/) - Status Line
* [urxvt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rxvt-unicode) - Terminal
* [emacs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Emacs) - Text Editor
* [compton](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Compton) - Xorg Compositor

## Additional Info
There are other configurations not included, either due to sensitive info or lack of importance.
While my setup is by no means 'riced', it looks decent enough and provides all the functionality I require.
If you'd like assistance getting a similar setup with Arch, feel free to contact me.
